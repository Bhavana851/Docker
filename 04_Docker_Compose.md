# Docker Compose 

- Docker Compose is a command used to bring up an entire application stack, with just one go.
- If I had a complete system, which container a Server, Redis, MySQL etc,
-  I would have to run Docker Run on each of these images and get the entire application stack working.
-  I might have to do the proper linking, and proper networking one by one as intended.
